## Key Findings

### 1. Media Coverage Bias by Geography & Sentiment
Western countries dominate coverage with a **positive tone toward Ukraine**, while emerging economies remain strategically neutral:
- **Western democracies**: Strong pro-Ukraine sentiment
- **Emerging markets (India, Global South)**: Strategic neutrality
- **China**: Minimal reporting, indicating limited narrative engagement
- **Conclusion**: Ukraine holds a stronger global narrative advantage

### 2. Publisher Sentiment Polarity

**Negative Publishers:**
- Dorset Echo
- Tom's Guide
- Thailandbusinessnews
- Digitaltrends
- Trueachievements

**Positive Publishers:**
- Kentonline
- Busselton Dunsborough Mail
- 411mania
- Globe Newswire
- Channel News

### 3. Information vs. Noise Analysis
Traditional news outlets deliver the most analytical content:
- **High Information, Low Noise**: Infotel, Tribune India, Reuters
- **High Noise, Low Information**: PR-focused outlets (Globe Newswire, Sportsrush) with repetitive coverage

**Key Insight:** Entertainment and PR-style publishers exhibit higher repetition and lower informational richness.

### 4. Geopolitical Framing Patterns
Coverage varies by geopolitical positioning:
- **India**: Strategic neutrality + analytical framing
- **Canada**: Social/public impact focus (Western-aligned)
- **China**: Limited, controlled narratives (Russia-aligned)
- **Smaller Nations**: Headline-only tracking with minimal analysis

### 5. Narrative Momentum: Ukraine vs. Russia
- **Early Phase**: Neutral-to-positive framing for Russia
- **Mid to Late Phase**: Steady increase in positive Ukraine sentiment, surpassing Russia
- **Conclusion**: Ukraine has achieved narrative superiority over time

### 6. Global Media Sentiment Mapping
**Pro-Ukraine Narrative Dominance:**
- Most countries: Positive or neutral sentiment
- Western democracies: Strongest pro-Ukraine support
- Global South: Predominantly neutral
- Strong anti-Ukraine sentiment: Rare globally

**Overall Assessment:** Media environment is relatively information-oriented with a consistent sympathetic tilt toward Ukraine, rather than heavily propagandistic.
